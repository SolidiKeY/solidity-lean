* Solidity in Lean
** Motivation
- Ethereum is the second-biggest cryptocurrency and the biggest smart contract platform
- Solidity is the programming language to create contracts in this cryptocurrency
- Code in the smart contracts domain can not be changed after deployment
- It is totally open
- Used for financial assets
- There are adversary interests in the smart contracts ecosystem
- Identity behind addresses is anonymous
** Solidity details
- Solidity has two kinds of memory, storage and memory
- Storage is persistent in the blockchain while memory is erased after a transaction
