# Semantics extensions

Status (2026-11-05): **authorized; not yet implemented.** Six structural
additions beside [full-scope.md](full-scope.md), which covers the language (X),
the optimizer (O) and solc validation (T). These groups add metatheory that
X, O and T state separately today. Every lane starts with an inventory of
`Bridge/`, `Solidity/Tools/` and `docs/`, so it reuses what exists.

## Groups

Each group follows the [VM execution contract](../coverage-plan.md#vm-execution-contract):
code, kernel-checked proofs, inhabited witnesses, negative controls,
finder/skeptic review, handoff in this document.

### S1 — contextual equivalence at the ABI boundary

| Group | Deliverable | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| S1.1 | **Definition.** One relation `CtxEquiv c₁ c₂`: for every caller, callback strategy and transaction sequence (the G50 adversary), both deployed contracts give the same outputs, revert data, logs and final observable state. A preorder `CtxRefines` for nondeterministic sides. Reflexivity, transitivity, congruence under sequencing. | G50 adversary interface |
| S1.2 | **Unification.** Prove that each existing notion implies (or equals) it: O's D6 relation, T's `Refines`, G49/G50 compiler correctness, `Semantics/RecursiveStorage/Observations.lean`, and the VY3 assembly notes. Restate the public theorems through `CtxEquiv`/`CtxRefines`; old names become corollaries. | S1.1, O01 and T07 interfaces (stubs) |
| S6.2 | **Revert data in formulas.** Revert bytes and (once X07 lands) logs readable in `dl{…}` formulas, with printers; closes the open row in `docs/semantic-gaps.md`. | S1.1 |

### S3 — mutability soundness

| Group | Deliverable | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| S3.1 | **Metatheorems over all well-typed programs.** A `view` body leaves storage, transient storage and balances unchanged in every outcome; a `pure` body's result does not depend on state; a non-payable function reverts whenever `msg.value > 0`. | typed source semantics |
| S3.2 | **`assignable` soundness.** The frame of [function-specs.md](../function-specs.md) follows from the same theorem. | S3.1 |
| S3.3 | **Closer frame facts.** The closer gets the frame facts for free; replace the per-example checks (`Examples/Tactics/TransientStorage.lean`) with uses of the theorem. | S3.1, S3.2 |

### S4 — type soundness (progress)

| Group | Deliverable | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| S4.1 | **Progress.** A well-typed program never gets stuck: every run returns, reverts, panics, or runs out of fuel or gas. | typed source semantics |
| S4.2 | **Tuples and remaining constructs.** Progress for tuple declarations and assignments (today "without a progress theorem") and every construct X adds, stated so X08 can cite it. | S4.1; X lanes add cases as they land |

### S5 — environment vs compiler nondeterminism

| Group | Deliverable | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| S5.1 | **Split.** Environment nondeterminism (callers, callbacks, block fields, transaction order) stays universally quantified; compiler nondeterminism becomes an explicit parameter: legacy vs via-IR evaluation order (O9) and gas values under D1. | D1 (X01 contracts) |
| S5.2 | **Both pipelines.** Theorems may state "holds under both pipelines"; D1's non-circularity argument is checked against the parameter. | S5.1 |
| S6.1 | **Fork parameter.** A fork/version parameter, so D2's Osaka choices and `block.slotnum` are not hardcoded; Osaka becomes one instance. | S5.1, X02/X03 interfaces |

### S2 — upgradeability

| Group | Deliverable | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| S2.1 | **Layout extension check.** A decidable check that V2's storage layout extends V1's, using D3's layout and the ERC-7201 namespaces already evaluated. Proved sound. | X06, S1.1 |
| S2.2 | **Upgrade step.** Proxy over `delegatecall` (X04): swap the implementation, keep storage. | X04, S2.1 |
| S2.3 | **Upgrade theorem.** An upgrade preserves V1's invariant, or meets V2's initializer precondition; stated through `CtxRefines`. | S1.2, S2.2 |

## Lanes

One 16 GiB VM, eight to ten hours, a dependency chain of groups; push each
finished step.

| Lane | Checkpoints, in order | Starts after |
|---|---|---|
| VS1 | inventory, S1.1, S1.2, S6.2 | — (against O/T interface stubs; final check after they land) |
| VS2 | inventory, S3.1, S3.2, S3.3 | — |
| VS3 | inventory, S4.1, S4.2 | — |
| VS4 | inventory, S5.1, S5.2, S6.1 | X01 contracts (VX1) for the final check |
| VS5 | inventory, S2.1, S2.2, S2.3 | VS1's S1.1, X04 (VX3), X06 (VX4) |

Wave 1: VS1–VS4 in parallel. Wave 2: VS5. Owned files: VS1 new
`Solidity/Semantics/CtxEquiv/**`; VS2 new `Solidity/Theory/Mutability/**`;
VS3 new `Solidity/Theory/Progress/**`; VS4 new
`Solidity/Semantics/Nondeterminism/**` and the fork parameter's module; VS5 new
`Solidity/Theory/Upgrade/**`. Edits to files that X, O or T lanes own go to
their owner as requests. Register new modules with
`scripts/coord-tools/register.sh` and add `docs/module-map/` rows.
