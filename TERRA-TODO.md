## NJ1 — completed for the fixed fixture

The exact original decoder equality, packet and compilation/source/model
endpoints are now kernel-proved in the actual module
`SolidityBridge.Yul.StructuredSwitchJsonKernelAttachment`, namespace
`SolidityBridge.Yul.StructuredSwitchJson.KernelControls`:

- `raw_nested_parsed`: `blockAux 20 ast = .ok tree`, with no parser premise.
- `raw_nested_packet`: the original `Packet [] 20 16 (Controls.fixture "1")`.
- `raw_nested_compiles`: exact `checkCompile` equality returning that packet.
- `raw_nested_source`: actual closed-word execution at horizon16.
- `raw_nested_low_fuel`: exact compiler horizon2 refusal for the same fixture.
- `raw_nested_model`: arbitrary mathematical machine/caller, with the real
  represented-stack premise retained.

Bounds20/16, dirty literal, fixture and expected prefix21/999/42/17 are unchanged.
Earlier failed attempts are preserved as evidence. No NJ1 proof remains pending;
this closes only the fixed-fixture obligation, not generic JSON correctness,
Solidity admission, Source/G24/native adequacy or the full original lane.
No earlier excluded Terra tasks or completed work are restored here.
